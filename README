NAME
    Cwd - get pathname of current working directory

SYNOPSIS
        use Cwd;
        my $dir = getcwd;

        use Cwd 'abs_path';
        my $abs_path = abs_path($file);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functions for determining the pathname of the
    current working directory. It is recommended that getcwd (or another
    *cwd() function) be used in *all* code to ensure portability.

    By default, it exports the functions cwd(), getcwd(), fastcwd(), and
    fastgetcwd() (and, on Win32, getdcwd()) into the caller's namespace.

  getcwd and friends
    Each of these functions are called without arguments and return the
    absolute path of the current working directory.

    getcwd
            my $cwd = getcwd();

        Returns the current working directory.

        Re-implements the getcwd(3) (or getwd(3)) functions in Perl.

    cwd
            my $cwd = cwd();

        The cwd() is the most natural form for the current architecture. For
        most systems it is identical to `pwd` (but without the trailing line
        terminator).

    fastcwd
            my $cwd = fastcwd();

        A more dangerous version of getcwd(), but potentially faster.

        It might conceivably chdir() you out of a directory that it can't
        chdir() you back into. If fastcwd encounters a problem it will
        return undef but will probably leave you in a different directory.
        For a measure of extra security, if everything appears to have
        worked, the fastcwd() function will check that it leaves you in the
        same directory that it started in. If it has changed it will "die"
        with the message "Unstable directory path, current directory changed
        unexpectedly". That should never happen.

    fastgetcwd
          my $cwd = fastgetcwd();

        The fastgetcwd() function is provided as a synonym for cwd().

    getdcwd
            my $cwd = getdcwd();
            my $cwd = getdcwd('C:');

        The getdcwd() function is also provided on Win32 to get the current
        working directory on the specified drive, since Windows maintains a
        separate current working directory for each drive. If no drive is
        specified then the current drive is assumed.

        This function simply calls the Microsoft C library _getdcwd()
        function.

  abs_path and friends
    These functions are exported only on request. They each take a single
    argument and return the absolute pathname for it. If no argument is
    given they'll use the current working directory.

    abs_path
          my $abs_path = abs_path($file);

        Uses the same algorithm as getcwd(). Symbolic links and
        relative-path components ("." and "..") are resolved to return the
        canonical pathname, just like realpath(3).

    realpath
          my $abs_path = realpath($file);

        A synonym for abs_path().

    fast_abs_path
          my $abs_path = fast_abs_path($file);

        A more dangerous, but potentially faster version of abs_path.

  $ENV{PWD}
    If you ask to override your chdir() built-in function,

      use Cwd qw(chdir);

    then your PWD environment variable will be kept up to date. Note that it
    will only be kept up to date if all packages which use chdir import it
    from Cwd.

NOTES
    *   Since the path seperators are different on some operating systems
        ('/' on Unix, ':' on MacPerl, etc...) we recommend you use the
        File::Spec modules wherever portability is a concern.

    *   Actually, on Mac OS, the "getcwd()", "fastgetcwd()" and "fastcwd()"
        functions are all aliases for the "cwd()" function, which, on Mac
        OS, calls `pwd`. Likewise, the "abs_path()" function is an alias for
        "fast_abs_path()".
